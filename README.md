# prework-study-guide
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This study guide was created for bootcamp students based on the prework modules. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and Javascript. This project was built to act as an on-going study guide that will be useful throughout the entirety of the Bootcamp for brushing up on core information, commands, and troubleshooting. In addition to creating a home for information that will be necessary, it served as a learning experience in the practical use of coding by directly designing an application that will host this information.
